A Whole Lotta Crud
------------------

Databases suck. They're huge, monolithic masses of information which are
unfortunately necessary for any technology that needs to remember stuff 
longer than a goldfish does. Fortunately, SQL exists! SQL, or Structured Query
Language, is a computer language that allows you to interact with databases
easily. Well, not that easily. Let's have a look.

There are four key actions we want to do when interacting with databases. This
is appropriately named CRUD.

C = Create - when we want to INSERT new information into our database table.
R = Read - when we want tp see information associated with an existing entry.
U = Update - when we want to change existing entries in the database table.
D = - Delete - bet you can't guess what this does.

So if we have a table called Made in Chelsea, we can:

CREATE (name) VALUES ('Binky')
SELECT * FROM made_in_chelsea
UPDATE made_in_chelsea SET name = 'JP' WHERE name = 'Binky'
DELETE FROM made_in_chelsea WHERE name = 'Ollie'
